# Contributing

If you are interested you are welcome to contribute to the repository through pull requests.

If you have a strong need for a model that is not covered in this package (and do not want to code it yourself) send me an email or a suggestion in Github

## Short guide/suggestions

TODO
The points below are mostly reminders for me but hopefully it can help others

* Use the `devtools` package to create R files, test files, vignettes etc
* In the R folder:
  - `bpc.R`: this contains a single function (rather large) that is the main function call of the package. We currently have only a single Stan model with lots of optional parameters. These are configured in the main bpc function
  - `bpc_exports.R`: these are helper functions to handle the `bpc` object and are exposed to the user. Only add here functions that receive a bpc object and that the users will have an interest.
  - `bpc_get_probabilities.R` Get probabilities related functions
  - `bpc_get_rank_of_players.R` Get rank related functions
  - `bpc_get_parameters.R` Get parameters related functions
  - `bpc_plot.R` Functions for possible plots
  - `bpc_helpers_X.R` additional functions to facilitate and support either the bpc function or the exports functions. None of these functions should be exported, although all of them should be documented. We divided these helpers in several files. the indexes are related to creating and checking names and indexes in lookup tables, the hpd to HPDI related functions, the checks to check correct specification of the data frame columns
  - `bpc_s3.R` all functions here are the custom implementation of the generic base functions from R, such as `summary`, `print`, `predict` and `plot`
    - Generated quantities is implemented in the `predict` function and in the file `bpc_btpredict.R`
  - `data-docs.R` documentation for the data.
  - `bpc_object.R` declaration and creation of the bpc class.

<!-- After adding the models and tests run `devtools::test()` and then `devtools::check()`. If everything is fine we can add the code and run R CMD check on the different platforms with Github actions -->


## Github actions

Currently we rely on few Github actions from r-lib with some modifications to install `cmdstanr` and `cmdstan.` Basic code comes from the `cmdstanr` actions.

* R-CMD-check standard. This checks in windows latest, macOS latest, ubuntu latest and ubuntu devel
* pkgdown. The pkg site is build automatically
* test-coverage. Runs covr automatically and upload to codecov
