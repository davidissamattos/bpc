  title: bpcs - A package for Bayesian Paired Comparison analysis with Stan
  description:  The bpcs package provides pre compiled Stan models for the analysis of paired comparison data. The models include Bayesian versions of the Bradley-Terry model, including random effects (1 level), generalized model for predictors, order effect (home advantage) and the same variations for the Davidson (1970) model to handle ties. Additionally, we provide a number of functions to facilitate inference and obtaining results with these models.
