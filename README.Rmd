The `bpcs` package performs Bayesian estimation of Paired Comparison models utilizing Stan, such as variations of the Bradley-Terry [@bradley1952rank] and the Davidson models [@davidson1970extending].

Package documentation and vignette articles can be found at: https://davidissamattos.github.io/bpcs/


## Installation

For the `bpcs` package to work, we rely upon the Stan software and the `rstan` package [@rstan]. 

* For general installation of Stan and RStan see: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started
* For macOS: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Installing-RStan-from-source-on-a-Mac
* For Linux: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Installing-RStan-on-Linux
* For Windows: https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/Installing-RStan-from-source-on-Windows 

At the moment we are not available in CRAN. To install the bpc package install directly from our Github repository

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=T}
remotes::install_github('davidissamattos/bpcs')
```

After install we load the package with:
```{r}
library(bpcs)
```


## Minimal example

The main function of the package is the `bpc` function. For the simple Bradley-Terry model, this function requires a specific type of data frame that contains:

* Two columns containing the name of the contestants in the paired comparison
* Two columns containing the score of each player OR  one column containing the result of the match (0 if player0 won, 1 if player1 won, 2 if it was a tie)

We will utilize the tennis dataset available [@agresti2003categorical]. The dataset can be seen below and is available as `data(tennis_agresti)`:

```{r}
knitr::kable(dplyr::sample_n(tennis_agresti,10))
```

Based on the scores of each contestant, the `bpc` function computes automatically who won the contest. Alternatively, you can provide a vector of who won if that is already available (for more information see `?bpc`.


For the simple Bradley Terry Model we specify the model type as `'bt'`. Here we hide the MCMC sampler chain messages for simplicity in the output. 

```{r}
m<-bpc(data = tennis_agresti, #datafrane
       player0 = 'player0', #name of the column for player 0
       player1 = 'player1', #name of the column for player 1
       result_column = 'y', #name of the column for the result of the match
       model_type = 'bt', #bt = Simple Bradley Terry model
       solve_ties = 'none' #there are no ties in the dataset so we can choose none here
       )
```

If `rstan` is available and correctly working this function should sample the posterior distribution and create a `bpc` object.

To see a summary of the results we can run:

```{r}
summary(m)
```


# Features of the bpcs package

* Bayesian computation of different variations of the Bradley-Terry (including with home advantage, random effects and the generalized model).
* Bayesian computation of different variations of the Davidson model to handle ties in the contest (including with home advantage, random effects and the generalized model).
* Accepts a column with the results of the contest or the scores for each player.
* Customize a normal prior distribution for every parameter.
* Compute HDP interval for every parameter with the `get_hpdi_parameters` function
* Compute rank of the players with the `get_rank_of_players` function.
* Compute all the probability combinations for one player beating the other with the `get_probabilities` function.
* Convert aggregated tables of results into long format (one contest per row) with the `expand_aggregated_data.`
* Obtain the posterior distribution for every parameter of the model with the `get_sample_posterior` function.
* Easy predictions using the `predict` function.
* We do not reinforce any table or plotting library! Results are returned as data frames for easier plotting and creating tables
* We reinforce the need to manually specify the model to be used.

## Models available

* Bradley-Terry (`bt`)  [@bradley1952rank]
* Davidson model (`davidson`) for handling ties [@davidson1970extending]
* Bradley-Terry with order effect (`btordereffect`). E.g. for home advantage [@davidson1977extending]
* Davidson model with order effect (`davidsonordereffect`). E.g. for home advantage with ties [@davidson1977extending]
* Generalized Bradley-Terry model (`btgeneralized`). When we have contestant specific predictors TODO:add ref
* Generalized Davidson model (`davidsongeneralized`). When we have contestant specific predictors and ties TODO:add ref
* Bradley-Terry model with intercept random effects (`btU`). For example to compensate clustering or repeated measures TODO:add ref
* Davidson model with intercept random effects (`davidsonU`). For example to compensate clustering or repeated measures when we have ties. TODO:add ref

Note that we currently don't variations and combinations of these models (e.g BT with order effect and random effect or generalized BT with order effect). Contact me if there is a need for one of these models and give me some examples so we can add to the vignettes!

## Roadmap

### Goals for bpcs 1.0.0 (before Chirstmas 2020)

- First official release
- Working and tested models for `bt`, `btordereffect`, `btgeneralized`, `btU`, `davidson`, `davidsonordereffect`, `davidsongeneralized`, `davidsonU`
- Vignettes covering all/most models

### Goals for bpcs 1.1.0 (Before June 2021)

- Reduce installation time by reducing number of stan models
  - The goal is to have fewer but more general stan models. 
  - This will increase the complexity of the stan model but will reduce code for the predict, get_probabilities, and the bpc function
- Add new models for modeling time effects (newer contests have higher impact on the ability than older contests)
- Add model for the Bayesian ELO-type rating system
- Improve test coverage to 70%


# Vignettes

This package provides a series of small and self contained vignettes that exemplify the use of each model. In the vignettes, we also provide examples of code for data transformation, tables and plots.

Below we list all our vignettes with a short description:

* [Getting Started](https://davidissamattos.github.io/bpcs/articles/get_started.html): This vignette shows a basic example on tennis competition data, covering how to run a Bradley-Terry model, MCMC diagnostics, posterior predictive values, ranking, predict new matches

* [Ties and home advantage](): This vignette covers a soccer example from the Brazilian soccer league. Here, we first model the results using a Bradley-Terry model and the Davidson model to handle ties. Then, we extend both models to include for order effects, this allows us to investigate the home advantage in and without the presence of ties. (TODO) 

* [Bradley-Terry with random effects](https://davidissamattos.github.io/bpcs/articles/bt_random_effects.html): This vignette covers the problem of ranking black-box optimization algorithms based on benchmarks. Since in benchmarking we often run the same optimization algorithm more than once with the same benchmark problem, we need to compensate for the repeated measures effect. We deal with this utilizing a simple Bradley-Terry model with random effects. We also have a variation of the Davidson model to include random effects.

*[Generalized Bradley-Terry model](): This vignette investigate the Bradley-Terry model when we have players specific characteristics. (TODO)

## Short guide/suggestions

The points below are mostly reminders for me but hopefully it can help others

* Use the `devtools` package to create R files, test files, vignettes etc
* In the R folder:
  - `bpc.R`: this contains a single function (rather large) that is the main function call of the package. Each new model should be added here in the if else section with the appropriated data list for stan. Dont forget to add the relevant documentation in roxygen2
  - `bpc_exports.R`: these are helper functions to handle the `bpc` object and are exposed to the user. Only add here functions that receive a bpc object and that the users will have an interest. 
  - `bpc_get_probabilities.R` Since this is a big export function we have moved it to its own file
  - `bpc_helpers_X.R` additional functions to facilitate and support either the bpc function or the exports functions. None of these functions should be exported, although all of them should be documented. We divided these helpers in several files. the indexes are related to creating and checking names and indexes in lookup tables, the hpd to HPDI related functions, the checks to check correct specification of the data frame columns
  - `bpc_s3.R` all functions here are the custom implementation of the generic base functions from R, such as summary, print, predict
  - `utils.R` dev functions to only. Not to be exported or used by the end user
  - `data-docs.R` documentation for the data.
  - `bpc_object.R` declaration and creation of the bpc class.
* To add new models:
  1. Add the stan file with the model in inst/stan.
    - Note that we add two stan files for each model, one that will estimate the parameters and one that will make predictions
  3. add the appropriated hooks in the `bpc` function in `bpc.R` so we can call the model
  4. add the appropriated hooks in the `predict` function in `bpc_s3.R`.
  5. add the appropriated hooks for the `get_probabilities` function in `bpc_get_probabilities.R`  to generate the appropriated probability table that is called in the `summary` function.
  6. add the relevant tests to each of the modifications (to be improved with time, since we have very few tests now)
* Problems with `rstantools` and compiling the models. For me at least, the combination of `RStudio`+ `rstantools` + `roxygen2` + `devtools` + `Rcpp`+ `devtools` gives an assorted amount of stochastic errors can usually be solved with a combination of the actions below. For me it is still trial and error to fix the error but it usually works with these actions:
  - Restart the r session and try `devtools::load_all()` again
  - After adding a model try `devtools::document()`
  - If deleting a model file delete the appropriated line in stanmodels.R and do document again
  - If the model is not recompiling or updating do `pkgbuild::clean_dll()` then `devtools::document()` and possibly `devtools::load_all()` or `devtools::install()`
